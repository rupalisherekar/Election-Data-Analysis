# Election-Data-Analysis

Had an enjoyable experience completing a project on Indian Election data Analysis for the year 2014 and 2019. With the election fever still running high , this project as a part of the Resume Project Challenge by Codebasics is fun.

Problem Statement: Provide unexplored insights on Loksabha elections of 2014 and 2019.
The data set is provided for public access by the election commission of India.
Data had to be prepared and cleaned. For example Telangana State was replaced for appropriate constituencies in 2014 elections data state. Spelling errors in constituency names of 2014 and 2019 data set were corrected. A few calculated tables were created for establishing relationships in the model. Around 40 metrics were made to answer the desired questions. The questions tackled were
-To find states and constituencies with highest and lowest voter turnout
-To find the cconstituencies loyal and disloyal to a single political party
-To find top 5 candidates who have won with the highest margins in both elections
-To find the split of votes between parties at national and state levels
-To find constituencies where top parties have gained and lost major vote share
-To find the constituency with highest NOTA votes
-To find the strong candidates wwho have won inspite of the party being weak in the state.

The Story that weaves is:
The eastern states along with Lakshwadeep are the ones with highest voting rates in both years whereas Northern states have a less voter turn out. Of this Kashmir is obvious. But surprisingly Maharashtra, Hyderabad constituency too have lesser voter turnout. These are the states with high literacy states . So literacy doesent seem to correlate with voting turnout ratio. A possibility for lesser voting could be the high temperatures in election months of April and May.
BJP evidently has had consecutive wins in majority of the states but Telangana,West Bengal ,Andhra simply have consecutively chosen TRS, AICT andYSRCP respectively.
Candidates from Navsari, Vadodara Gujrat have consecutively won with a very high marginn share

Overall BJP INC are the major parties. But in central India its AITC after BJP. INC tops consecutively in southern India. INC and AINRC dominate Union Territories with BJP at no 3. Surprisingly NOTA is at number 6 in 2019.
Many strong candidates have won despite their parties having less than 10% of votes in the state., Typically from J & K, Bihar and few INC candidates in the North and Eastern India.
INC recorded a rise in vote share in the south and BJP in Gujrat.
